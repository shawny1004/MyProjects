For the first part, I write a new rectangle class representing a rectangle, which has four
connecting line segments. The four line segments should connect consecutively and
be perpendicular to nearby line segments.

For the second part, I design a DeathlyHallow class as a composite symbol with a triangle, a line
and a circle in it. The circle should an incircle of the triangle and the line should share the same
endpoint with the triangle and the other endpoint should be at the midpoint of the opposite edge.

For the third part, I create a class called Snowman_Hat_Hands as my own symbol, representing a
snowman with hands and a hat. The symbol consists of a triangle, a snowman and two line segments.
The hat should be tangent with the snowman's head and the opposite endpoint should be on the
central line of the snowman. The two hands should be at different sides of the snowman and both are
outward.
